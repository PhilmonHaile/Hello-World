# H1 Hello-World - **A Repository all About me!**

Hello! My name is Philmon Haile and I am an aspiring DevOps engineer.I am also interested in Scrum Master/Release Traing engineering positions, and Cloud Engineering roles. I recently earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, and I am currently studying for the AWS Solution Architect certification. After graduting with a degree in Information Systems, I spent three years working in a professional setting at two different firms I have been impacted by the cooling job market, and have been recently laid off.

My work experience has comprised of 
*high level data analytics 
*Agile-Scrum based project management 
*process ownership
*and most recently change management at a big four consulting firm

Although my career trajectory has led me away from IT, I ultimately aspire to be the bridge between the technical world and the business side, and as my IT professors have said 
>"The best managers at technology firms are those who can roll up their sleeves and work with technical teams if they have to".

With the newly found free time I have, I am working on honing my technical skillsets through the development of a personal portfolio here on Github, and working in the cloud.
